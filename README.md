# Main - I call Dr. All-P
: The purpose for these sites is to allow me to. Nah, I can't do anything right so like pottery I make and crash sites I don't care about so I can make 
bigger and projects that I want to make. At the end of these planned 100+ sites I want to be comfortable enough to build sites, the ones I 
wanted to build for a while now.

- I will be mainly using HTML < CSS < JS < Vue < Nuxt, < Node.js < Firebase. Figma maybe? ? ? I do prototypes by 
drawing so I think it would be a better transition. But mainly I want to experiment with things so I can build. 

- I also want to see if I could make it so that the I don't give any information away that I really  don't want t give. Making it a mixture of 
private and public. Also I want to see if I can online and offline things.

## Haha. I was expecting that. I counter with..

I will switch reposoteries if I make an app, or switch to using other platforms, services or languages. For my first one I am just using HTML, CSS,
and JS. (I should put this on top?). But my app Dodgeball island will use, Firebase as well. Mainly to create a user id and the islands for it. So 
that will go to another one like all firebase things. Maybe I'll just do

1 rep: HTML, CSS, Js
1 rep:  ---, Firebase 
1 rep: ---, Vue. and Nuxt.js.
1 rep: node.js
1: rep: for all

I don't know how they work so it will change but the first, second, and last are for sure. Cause otherwise it will just blow my mind with the files
in one folder.

## Lord OverArch the First

Why public? I hope some unlucky soul lands here. So I can just tell him someone somewhere is working why he isn't. (Yeah) But also beacuse it's hard
to find these kinds of things for people with no experience. I think 
1. Telling your complier (Visual Studio)
2. Start to end. (Numbered)
3. Extra codes you tried. (Inside Comments)
4. Downloads and your dependencies (homebrew, git, firebase, and other things that I will update). And how you got them can help people.

So, I will try to do it that way.
