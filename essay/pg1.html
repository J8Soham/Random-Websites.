        <title>The Past</title>
        <div>
            <p>Life constanly blurs and fades so here is my attempt to salvage parts of</p>
            <p> I don't know if I should cause somethings are better to die. But 
                in the invert of memory there are the visions. So I want to help them. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> I don't remeber much from when I was younger there are only picutres, even 
                they have been deleted mistakenly. But from what I heard I was mischeivous and asked for stories alot
                people were tired so I didn't get to listen that much so I made some.
                Somewhere there I got silent, I was the kid on the back and just observed people for my own stories.
                I don't know what I spent my time on. There are a few fragments of me playing with friends. I got a phone 
                to play with when I was in 5th grade, one of the old samsung ones I borrowed from my mom. 
                More than anything I loved to tell stories (libary stuck kid) to others and tell about the realities in my head.
            </p>
            <p> When I was younger I used to play with my cousins a game where we would set up stalls and trade
                I used to roam around stuff and make descrtptions, history, and myths about what the things are worth
                somewhere down I think that was what we were selling. I loved to just roam around the house and other places, 
                (still do), and just dig stuff out of things. Like weird old things and them break or open them. Then figure out a 
                way to not get snitched on or found out.
            </p>
            <p> I been reading a lot about other people like Chia Amisola (today) & Jacky Zhao (2 months ago). They have been on
                the internet for so long. Early on they started making and designing things. I haven't even as of today. Or
                maybe my inventions are slipping out of my mind. Like conversations. I had so many conversations from 5-7 grade with
                my friend. WE talked about anime, cards, scratch, built games (paper and code), and played games with friends. 
                I always feel like the another friend to have. The kind to help others take space. Cause there used to be time when
                I didn't. Like I also remeber that I used to play outside a lot. Like at late night since morning I used to make these
                sand wars wiht my friends. Like till 10 when our noses would be dripping and the cold would prick our skin clausses from the sand.
                Truth be told I made a lot of stories and things, but they have all been temproral. Like conversations, writing, reading,
                thoughts, sand castles, forts, tree spaces, weapons, stories, puzzles, cards, origami, codes. 
            </p>
            <p> I have spent a lot of time consuming. That sounds bad to me but it has felt so good. Like just being able to learn about diffrent 
                people in the world. I have had so many ideas but haven't started them. So many games and designs. When I used to play soccer
                I used to think about a potential game. How it would look like, what it would teach, how I would make it. Truth be told I am Like
                a small puppy. Got bitten by one once. I roam around a lot, sniff a of people, and continue to chase my tail. But I know something
                that when I lie down or begin to learn I can do that amazingly. But it still scares me that I am to far enough to even start running.
                
                There is also a matter of fact that I can only run so much and like isn't a 100 meter dash. Right?

                I don't know I find these people to be inspiring to learn about. They are all there is to the world. I would know. I have
                learned of many stories. Many diaries I have read. I have this morbid desire to carry these lives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Libary was and is my solace. There were so many books, I started with reading the small pargraphs on the back and cover page.
                That was a fun hook to reality. To understand these were real people. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Something I am thinking about it "So much of my life has been about generally subverting, discarding what was deemed critical to ‘attend to’ at that point."
                Like what have I been pushing for things that I want to define me.
