This is just a random essay like others that promted me to take this road, like making things public for everyone to help others. One line
Chia Amisola wrote was to build things always for oor with others. Not exactly. But my interpretation of it, makes sense as I want to
build what I build for people to be shared and able to be trasparrent with myself people. 

That's hard to read. An example is a company like Google it builds the chrome browser right, so in my model it would publish the code
for how that works and make it legible for people who it considers its customers (users, not companies).
